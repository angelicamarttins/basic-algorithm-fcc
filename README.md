This repository is dedicated to keep the exercises made in [freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-algorithm-scripting), which I solved and refactured to exercise my JavaScript knowlegde and my logical thougth. 
All the exercises has, in the begging of the code, the explanation of the exercise. 

**Feel free to open an issue and suggest better solutions.**
